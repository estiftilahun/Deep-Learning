    "It is possible to install and run Python/PyTorch entirely from your computer, without the need for Google CoLab. Running PyTorch locally does require some software configuration and installation. If you are not comfortable with software installation, just use Google CoLab. These instructions show you how to install PyTorch for both CPU and GPU. Many of the examples in this project will achieve considerable performance improvement from a GPU.\n",

    "The first step is to install Python 3.7. I recommend using the Miniconda (Anaconda) release of Python, as it already includes many of the data science related packages that are needed by this class. Anaconda directly supports Windows, Mac, and Linux. Miniconda is the minimal set of features from the extensive Anaconda Python distribution. Download Miniconda from the following URL:\n",

Each environment that you create can have its own Python version, drivers, and Python libraries. I suggest that you create an environment to hold the Python instance for this project. Use the following command to create your environment. I am calling the environment **torch**, you can name yours whatever you like.\n",
